Dear Reader,

I have written a code for Penalized B-Spline implantation and attached it here. It is based on Chapter 14 in this book: "Alston, C.L., Mengersen, K.L. and Pettitt, A.N. eds., 2012. Case studies in Bayesian statistical modelling and analysis. John Wiley & Sons."

Please see it and let me know your opinion. You should have already installed "rstan" and "splines" library in R. I hope to be useful to a person.


With Best Wishes for Stan Group,
Bistoon
